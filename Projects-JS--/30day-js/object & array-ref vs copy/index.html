      // start with strings, numbers and booleans
      // let age = 100;
      // let age2 = age;
      // console.log(name, name2); //==>100,100
      // name = 30;
      // console.log(name, name2); //==> 30,10 //see index.js for explain

      // let name = "wes";
      // let name2 = name;
      // console.log(name, name2); //==>wes,wes
      // name = "ish";
      // console.log(name, name2); //==>ish,wes

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players;
      console.log(players, team);

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      // players.push("New Player");
      // team[3] = "Lux";

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = player.slice(); //player.slice(2,3)

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players); //no change original

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players]; //no change original
      team4[3] = "heeee hawww";
      console.log(team4);

      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      console.log(team5); //==>["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"]
      team5[3] = "cool"; //in console or  console.log(team5)==>["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "cool"] , while  console.log(players)==>  ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"]

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person;
      captain.number = 99;
      console.log(captain); //=>object{ name: "Wes Bos", age: 80, number:99}
      console.log(person); //=>object{ name: "Wes Bos", age: 80, number:99}

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}.person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
      console.log(cap2); //=>object{ name: "Wes Bos", age: 12, number:99}
      console.log(person); //=>object{ name: "Wes Bos", age: 80}

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const cap3 = { ...person };

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
      // If you are using ES6, you can use the spread operator to make a copy of
      // an array or object. This is the most modern and efficient way to do it.
      // If you are using ES5, you can use the slice method to make a copy of
      // an array, or the Object.assign method to make a copy of an object.

      const wes = {
        name: "Wes",
        age: 80,
        occupation: "Developer",
        social: {
          twitter: "@wesbos",
          facebook: "wesbosdev",
        },
      };
      console.log(wes);
      const wesCopy = { ...wes };
      const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
      //inconsole - dev.name if --"wesley", wes is still==> Object{name: "Wes",age: 80,occupation: "Developer",social: Object}, only change in dev is name to welsey
      //but this is in one level if you dev.social.twitter--@coolman, it changes both dev and wes because the copy is one level

      //for make full copy ignoring deeps other objects
      const wesCopyDeep = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
      console.log(wesCopyDeep); // this wont change wes, in this JSON.stringify(wes)--changes to string then JSON.parse changes to obj again
